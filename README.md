# TCP Watch v1.0.2
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Custom%20BSD-blue)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.2-green)
![Go Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.20+-00ADD8)

A real-time network monitoring & DDoS protection tool written in Go, featuring live traffic analysis, attack detection, and system resource monitoring.

- ## Improvements
  - Fixed flags that was not detecting
  - Fixed tcp dump error displaying in tcp-watch
  - Improved BPF creation and handling
  - Improved display on blacklisted ips. Now clears the ips being displayed on screen when it reaches the end of the list to read. 
  - Automatically finds your default interface and utilizes it 
  - Added small ascii loading animation
  - More attack method detections
  - Source ports coming from harmful ips are now more accurate and stable
  - Added current interface to main ui
  - Working on themes, possibly licenses (soon)
  - Tcp dump, bpf work 2x as fast now at blocking traffic
  - Fixed error messages while running when resources get exhausted, to help it not spam your terminal or bug the ui
  - All ports should get detected now for traffic, this means no effort to edit default set port 22 inside the file, you can now leave default and still read traffic from other ports
  - Slightly enhanced the graph, memory, traffic totals to be more stable
  - Now requires no extra fields can just run it at default ttl for time of reloading on the script
  - Improved & cleaned up a good chunk of the code 
  - Improved cpu usage, resource consumption now being easier on startup for first time, when running
  - Improved and used better and newer code functions for all you geeks out there
  - More math logic has been added to help calculate certain functions more accurately
  - Fixed over half the bugs
  - Implemented permanent and semi permanent logs, one for a quick and easy display of attacking ips via tcp-watch that proceeds to flush, just mainly meant to allocate quick attack logs to. The other one is for permanent logs to view to help create filters, manual-bpf, attack & malicious traffic patches
  - Fixed static data and replaced with real server data. This static data was from the beta/test version of TCP-WATCH
  - Added a auto-smart bpf creator that runs in the background
  - Improved & implemented web server logs
  - Added a auto abuse db script that runs in the background and reports all ips in blacklist.log to abuse db **REQUIRES A ABUSE DB API KEY**
  - Added ipv6 support and tracking across all ports rather than a specific one for more detailed and robust banning, traffic detection
  - Fixed attack logs not being fully accurate most of the time unknown or the same reasoning now its completely accurate to what the ip was blocked for and its dst, src ports
  - Added to where old and new pcaps get deleted/flushed due to it already being logged in logs to make the script more efficent
  - Added -t timeout options between 30-300ms core components like proc net wont update and are set hard coded for 300 ms
  - Updated webserver

# üìã API HELP
You need to use the /data endpoint if you plan to run this on a dstat server ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7452a87-348b-4f4e-a400-13310a0b75e1)


# üß† Help
If you get an error **[./tcpwatch.go:552:13: duplicate key "IP" in map literal]** thats just due to you not putting your server ip in on line 571. You need to replace one of the "IP" literals with your ssh ip. This feature is so that tcp dump or any other protection measure doesn't accidentally blacklist your server ip and you should probably add yourself unless your adding ip tables, which this script does not interfer with ip tables just adds the malicious ips, ignores the ips you set in this field to your tables similar to an ip set.

# üß† LOGS
The blacklistedips.txt is a simple temporary log file for displaying it to the user (you) its just something the logs can quickly allocate to & be ready quickly so it can list all ips in the attacking ips section and flush it when its done reading / displaying so its more stable. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e482a15-9d7c-4bf2-8757-0ebe606b2f19)

When running TCP-WATCH, the blacklistedips.log works same as the .txt version but the .log is meant to keep long-term logs on all ips that have attacked and their methods, src ports, dst ports, size, connections etc. Its everything you need to improve your server infastructure without ever flushing the ips! Examples below

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b907c214-0176-4fa5-89aa-18e0d75a02a6)

Web logs when running TCP-WATCH webserver are advanced shows the ips, their source port they are connecting from and the destination port they are sending traffic/connecting to. Also shows the bytes sent and receieved
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ba4c8b9-65cb-4a12-a845-25fe6c50b5c9)

Automatic IP reporting of attacking ips are now implemented. To make this feature work please edit line 51 of **"abusedb.go"** to put your api key in it

# üß† TIMEOUT INTERVAL
If your encountering the error below, thats due to you setting your timeout any higher than 600ms or any timeout lower than 50ms
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cebbaf50-a926-4afd-b57d-9ff14a5144b2)

But if you stay between 50-600ms this will not happen and should load as usual as seen below ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ca4e23c-3912-4617-adc3-fc27d50bcf69)

A real-time network monitoring & DDoS protection tool written in Go, featuring live traffic analysis, attack detection, and system resource monitoring.

- ## Improvements
  - Fixed flags that was not detecting
  - Fixed tcp dump error displaying in tcp-watch
  - Improved BPF creation and handling
  - Improved display on blacklisted ips. Now clears the ips being displayed on screen when it reaches the end of the list to read. 
  - Automatically finds your default interface and utilizes it 
  - Added small ascii loading animation
  - More attack method detections
  - Source ports coming from harmful ips are now more accurate and stable
  - Added current interface to main ui
  - Working on themes, possibly licenses (soon)
  - Tcp dump, bpf work 2x as fast now at blocking traffic
  - Fixed error messages while running when resources get exhausted, to help it not spam your terminal or bug the ui
  - All ports should get detected now for traffic, this means no effort to edit default set port 22 inside the file, you can now leave default and still read traffic from other ports
  - Slightly enhanced the graph, memory, traffic totals to be more stable
  - Now requires no extra fields can just run it at default ttl for time of reloading on the script
  - Improved & cleaned up a good chunk of the code 
  - Improved cpu usage, resource consumption now being easier on startup for first time, when running
  - Improved and used better and newer code functions for all you geeks out there
  - More math logic has been added to help calculate certain functions more accurately
  - Fixed over half the bugs
  - Implemented permanent and semi permanent logs, one for a quick and easy display of attacking ips via tcp-watch that proceeds to flush, just mainly meant to allocate quick attack logs to. The other one is for permanent logs to view to help create filters, manual-bpf, attack & malicious traffic patches
  - Fixed static data and replaced with real server data. This static data was from the beta/test version of TCP-WATCH
  - Added a auto-smart bpf creator that runs in the background
  - Improved & implemented web server logs
  - Added a auto abuse db script that runs in the background and reports all ips in blacklist.log to abuse db **REQUIRES A ABUSE DB API KEY**
  - Added ipv6 support and tracking across all ports rather than a specific one for more detailed and robust banning, traffic detection
  - Fixed attack logs not being fully accurate most of the time unknown or the same reasoning now its completely accurate to what the ip was blocked for and its dst, src ports
  - Added to where old and new pcaps get deleted/flushed due to it already being logged in logs to make the script more efficent
  - Added -t timeout options between 30-300ms core components like proc net wont update and are set hard coded for 300 ms
  - Updated webserver
  - Added whitelist.txt instead of hardcoding for ease of access, to fix any errors if you dont edit it
  - Fixed old pcaps not being deleted. It now deletes pcaps upon loading TCP-WATCH
  - Fixed bpf, abuse db sessions not getting killed by simply process tree cleanup
  - Fixed when pcaps are in progress not displaying this was due to not having the feature that called to check to see if a pcap was currently in progress
  - Fixed bpf creation actually creates and applys bpf rules 

# üìã API HELP
You need to use the /data endpoint if you plan to run this on a dstat server but if you dont plan to than you can enjoy the dashboard with statistics and a live chart  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7452a87-348b-4f4e-a400-13310a0b75e1) 

# üß† LOGS
The blacklistedips.txt is a simple temporary log file for displaying it to the user (you) its just something the logs can quickly allocate to & be ready quickly so it can list all ips in the attacking ips section and flush it when its done reading / displaying so its more stable. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e482a15-9d7c-4bf2-8757-0ebe606b2f19)

When running TCP-WATCH, the blacklistedips.log works same as the .txt version but the .log is meant to keep long-term logs on all ips that have attacked and their methods, src ports, dst ports, size, connections etc. Its everything you need to improve your server infastructure without ever flushing the ips! Examples below

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b907c214-0176-4fa5-89aa-18e0d75a02a6)

Automatic IP reporting of attacking ips are now implemented. To make this feature work please edit line 51 of **"abusedb.go"** to put your api key in it

# üß† TIMEOUT INTERVAL
If your encountering the error below, thats due to you setting your timeout any higher than 600ms or any timeout lower than 50ms
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48975e38-db6d-470a-9082-8d90feba7590)

But if you stay between 50-600ms this will not happen and should load as usual as seen below ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8574281-38db-416d-9de7-de31c7e63073)

# üß† ABUSE DATABASE AUTOMATIC REPORTING API HELP.

# üß† ERROR WHEN RUNNING BPFMAKER.GO 
If your encountering this error make the ulimit 99999 or do ulimit -u 99999. But only happens if you run more than once on some hostings. You should only have to run once
